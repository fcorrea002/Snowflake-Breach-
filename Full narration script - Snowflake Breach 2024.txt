Tema: Snowflake Breach 2024 – Credential Harvesting, MFA Bypass and Massive Data Exfiltration

🔹 Slide 1 — Introduction
Hello, my name is Fernando Corrêa da Silva Júnior, i'm speaking from Brazil.
My GitHub username is fcorrea002, and my edX username is fcorrea007.
Today is January 9, 2026.
In this presentation, I will discuss a recent cybersecurity incident: the Snowflake Breach, which occurred between May and June 2024.
This incident did not have a formal CVE number, because it was not caused by a Snowflake vulnerability, but by compromised customer credentials stolen through infostealer malware.
I selected this topic because it directly relates to themes we studied in this course, including privacy, authentication, credential management, cloud security, and the consequences of failing to apply MFA.

🔹 Slide 2 — What is Snowflake?
Snowflake is one of the largest cloud data warehouse platforms in the world.
It stores sensitive data from global companies such as banks, fintechs, major retailers, cybersecurity companies, and even government agencies.
Because Snowflake centralizes massive datasets, it is a high-value target for cybercriminals.

🔹 Slide 3 — What Happened? (Incident Overview)
Between late May and early June 2024, multiple Snowflake customer environments were accessed illegally.
Attackers used valid usernames and passwords previously stolen by infostealer malware installed on employee laptops.
No Snowflake systems were breached — instead, attackers authenticated successfully using stolen customer credentials.
Since many victims did not enable MFA, the attackers logged in normally and exported large volumes of data.

🔹 Slide 4 — Attack Timeline
March–May 2024:
Infostealer malware infections captured employee browser-stored credentials.
Late May 2024:
Attackers tested credentials against Snowflake logins.
May 30 – June 5, 2024:
Multiple successful logins occurred.
Large data sets were exfiltrated through Snowflake’s native export functionalities.
June 2024:
Ransomware and extortion groups began offering stolen Snowflake datasets for sale on dark web forums.

🔹 Slide 5 — How Credentials Were Stolen
Infostealer malware such as RedLine, Lumma, and Vidar targeted employee devices.
These tools extract:
	• Saved passwords
	• Session cookies
	• Autofill data
	• Browser-stored tokens
Attackers purchased these logs on marketplaces such as Russian Market and used them to gain access to Snowflake accounts.

🔹 Slide 6 — Why MFA Failed (or Didn’t Exist)
The majority of victims had no MFA enforced in their Snowflake accounts.
Snowflake only recently began requiring MFA, so many organizations were still using password-only authentication.
Some accounts also used legacy authentication methods with weak controls and no geolocation or IP restrictions.

🔹 Slide 7 — Attackers’ Objectives
The attackers had three clear goals:
	1. Full data exfiltration: They exported terabytes of customer data.
	2. Extortion: Victims were told to pay to prevent public leaks.
	3. Sale of stolen datasets on darknet forums.
Examples of stolen data include:
	• PII
	• Financial records
	• Transactional logs
	• Database tables
	• Internal business intelligence datasets

🔹 Slide 8 — Impact on Organizations
The breach affected multiple industries:
	• Financial institutions
	• Retail corporations
	• Security companies
	• SaaS providers
	• Cryptocurrency exchanges
Impacts included:
	• Reputational damage
	• Mandatory customer notifications
	• Regulatory investigations
	• Potential class-action lawsuits
	• Loss of competitive data
	• Operational disruption

🔹 Slide 9 — Lessons Learned (Technical Analysis)
This incident reinforces several key points:
	• MFA must always be enforced for cloud platforms.
	• Credential theft remains one of the easiest attack vectors.
	• Browser-stored passwords are extremely high risk.
	• Detection mechanisms should analyze login anomalies:
		○ unusual IPs
		○ impossible travel
		○ massive data exports
Most importantly:
A cloud vendor can be secure, but customers must also secure their accounts.

🔹 Slide 10 — How Snowflake Responded
Snowflake initiated:
	• Forced MFA rollout
	• Temporary session invalidations
	• Credential resets
	• Enhanced anomaly detection
	• Customer notifications
	• Updated security documentation
They also collaborated with:
	• Mandiant
	• CrowdStrike
	• Law enforcement agencies

🔹 Slide 11 — Recommendations
To avoid similar incidents:
For Organizations
	• Enforce MFA for all cloud users
	• Use SSO + Identity Providers
	• Block browser-stored credentials
	• Implement EDR to detect infostealers
	• Apply network restrictions (IP allowlists)
	• Monitor high-volume data exports
	• Use password managers instead of browser storage
For Individuals
	• Never store corporate passwords in browsers
	• Use hardware MFA keys
	• Avoid accessing cloud systems on personal devices

🔹 Slide 12 — Final Thoughts
The Snowflake breach makes one thing clear:
Strong authentication is more important than ever.
The cloud was not hacked — humans were.
By strengthening identity controls and reducing exposure to credential theft, organizations can prevent incidents like this from occurring again.
